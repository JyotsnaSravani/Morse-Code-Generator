Morse code is a method of encoding text characters as sequences of dots (.) and dashes (-). Each letter of the alphabet and each digit is represented by a unique combination of these signals. This system was historically used for telegraphy and is still recognized as a simple and reliable form of communication.

In Morse code, letters and numbers are translated into patterns made up of short signals (dots) and long signals (dashes). For example, the letter A is represented by .- (dot followed by dash), B by -... (dash followed by three dots), and the digit 1 by .---- (one dot followed by four dashes). Spaces between letters are indicated by a short pause (or space in text), and spaces between words are commonly shown as /.

Here is an example of how to encode the message "HELLO" into Morse code:

Write down the plaintext message: HELLO

Replace each letter with its Morse code equivalent:

H = .... (four dots)

E = . (one dot)

L = .-.. (dot dash dot dot)

L = .-..

O = --- (three dashes)

Separate each Morse code letter with a space:
.... . .-.. .-.. ---

The encoded Morse code for “HELLO” is:
.... . .-.. .-.. ---

To decode Morse code back to text, the process is reversed:

Each sequence of dots and dashes is matched to its corresponding letter or digit.

Spaces separate individual Morse letters, and / or extra spaces separate words.

For example, decoding the Morse code .... . .-.. .-.. --- gives the original text “HELLO”.
