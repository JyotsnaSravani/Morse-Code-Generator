# Morse Code Generator 

Morse Code Generator is a console-based C program that converts English text to Morse code and decodes Morse code back to text. The program supports letters (A-Z), digits (0-9), and word separation using “/”. It features a menu-driven interface, efficient mapping between characters and Morse symbols, and handles input validation gracefully.This project has deepened my understanding of basic communication protocols by implementing a real-world encoding system. Challenges faced included managing bidirectional conversions, handling spacing between words, and ensuring the program processes input case-insensitively. Overall, the project enhanced my algorithm design and modular programming skills and provides a solid foundation for future enhancements such as adding punctuation support, audio playback of Morse signals, or graphical interfaces.
