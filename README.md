# Morse Code Generator 

Morse Code Generator is a console-based C program that converts English text to Morse code and decodes Morse code back to text. The program supports letters (A-Z), digits (0-9), and word separation using “/”. It features a menu-driven interface, efficient mapping between characters and Morse symbols, and handles input validation gracefully.
